# Cplusplus-Program

What did you do particularly well? The switch case
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on? Trying to do it from 24 hour back to 12 hour
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network? Getting 11:59:59 PM to change to 12:00:00 AM. I used bool isPM and if (hour == 12) { isPM = !isPM }
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or coursework? Using switch cases
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Putting inline comments
